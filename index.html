    <h1>Akan Names</h1>
    <p>The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and the order in which they were born. ... Many of the leaders of slave rebellions had "day names" including Cuffy or Kofi, Cudjoe or Kojo, and Quamina or Kwame/Kwamina.</p>
